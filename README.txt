# Beginner Turbo — EXACT look (fixes pack)

This keeps your original Turbo look. It fixes:
- Level 1 not responding (robust delegated click handler + explicit button type).
- Present button styling: stays ACTIVE but non-clickable, matching your theme.
- Crest softened slightly.

## Files
- `index.html` — same structure, plus a tiny `style-override.css` link after your original `style.css`.
- `style-override.css` — only the three overrides requested.
- `script.js` — same logic but with reliable init + level click delegation.

## How to use
Upload these three files alongside your existing `style.css` into your beginner repo. Do not change your original `style.css`.

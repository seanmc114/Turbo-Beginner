# Beginner Turbo â€” EXACT look + random interrogative/negative

This keeps your original Turbo layout/styles. Only logic changed:
- Each question randomly becomes **affirmative**, **negative**, or **interrogative**.
- Spanish answers accepted:
  - Affirmative: `conjugation` or `pronoun + conjugation` (e.g., `soy` or `yo soy`)
  - Negative: `no + conjugation` or `pronoun + no + conjugation` (e.g., `no soy`, `yo no soy`)
  - Interrogative: same as affirmative (punctuation not required)
- Robust Level 1 click and Present button styling preserved.

**How to use**
Upload `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style-override.css` alongside your original `style.css` in your beginner repo.
